[EXPLANATION]
The provided Chef Recipe has been converted into an Ansible Playbook. The playbook consists of three plays:

1. Remove proxy from /etc/apt/apt.conf: This play removes any lines containing "Acquire::http::Proxy" from the /etc/apt/apt.conf file.
2. Configure apt cacher client: This play configures the apt cacher client by creating the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy file using a template. It uses variables like cacher_ipaddress, port, proxy_ssl, and bypass to populate the template.
3. Include apt default recipe: This play includes the default apt recipe from the apt role.

The playbook uses the "when" condition to ensure that tasks are only executed when necessary. For example, the task to create the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy file is only executed when there are servers available. Similarly, the task to delete the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy file is only executed when there are no servers available.

The playbook assumes that the 01proxy.erb template is available in the same directory as the playbook.
