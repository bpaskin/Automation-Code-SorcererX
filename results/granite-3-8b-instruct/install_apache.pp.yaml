Please note that the above playbook assumes that the `apache` module has two variables: `apache_disable` and `apacheconf`.

`apache_disable` is a boolean variable used to decide if apache should be running or stopped. 

`apacheconf` is a string variable used to decide the source of the httpd configuration file. If it's 'default', it will use the configuration file from within the module.

Also, this playbook uses templates (`template: puppet:///modules/apache/httpd.conf`), you need to create these files in the `templates` directory within `puppet:///modules/apache/httpd.conf` for this playbook to work correctly.
