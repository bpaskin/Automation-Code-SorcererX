Here is my response:

```yaml
---
- hosts: mysql_servers
  become: yes
  vars:
    mysql_root_password: "your_root_password"
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure MySQL Server is installed
      apt:
        name: mysql-server
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable MySQL Server
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Create MySQL Database
      become_user: root
      ansible.builtin.command: "mysql -uroot -p{{ mysql_root_password }} -e 'create database {{ item }}'"
      loop:
        - "{{ mysql_db_name }}"
      register: db_creation
      until: db_creation.rpc_retcode == 0
      retries: 5
      delay: 5
```

Note: Replace `mysql_servers` with your actual target hosts and `your_root_password` with the appropriate MySQL root password. Also, ensure `mysql_db_name` is defined elsewhere in your playbook or passed as a variable.
